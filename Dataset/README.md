**CSEMOTIONS** is a high-quality Mandarin emotional speech dataset designed for expressive speech synthesis, emotion recognition, and voice cloning research. The dataset contains studio-quality recordings from six professional voice actors across seven carefully curated emotional categories, supporting research in controllable and natural language speech generation.


## Dataset Summary

- **Name:** CSEMOTIONS
- **Total Duration:** ~10 hours
- **Speakers:** 10 (5 male, 5 female) native Mandarin speakers, all professional voice actors
- **Emotions:** Neutral, Happy, Angry, Sad, Surprise, Disgust, Fear
- **Language:** Mandarin Chinese
- **Sampling Rate:** 48kHz, 24-bit PCM
- **Recording Setting:** Professional studio environment
- **Evaluation Prompts:** 100 per emotion, in both English and Chinese

## Dataset Structure

Each data sample includes:

- **audio**: The speech waveform (48kHz, 24-bit, WAV)
- **transcript**: The transcribed sentence in Mandarin
- **emotion**: One of {neutral, happy, angry, sad, surprise, disgust, fear}
- **speaker_id**: An anonymized speaker identifier (e.g., `S01`)
- **gender**: Male/Female
- **prompt_id**: Unique identifier for each utterance


## Intended Uses

CSEMOTIONS is intended for:

- Expressive text-to-speech (TTS) and voice cloning systems
- Speech emotion recognition (SER) research
- Cross-lingual and cross-emotional synthesis experiments
- Benchmarking emotion transfer or disentanglement models
