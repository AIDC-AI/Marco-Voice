## üìñ Overview

This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning, emotion control, and cross-lingual synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts.

Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that Marco-Voice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

## üìå Main Contributions

### 1. Marco-Voice Model:
- We develop a speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism that separates speaker identity from emotional expression, enabling independent control over voice cloning and emotional style. We also proposed to employ in-batch contrastive learning to further disentangle speaker identity with emotional style feature.
-  We implement a rotational emotion embedding integration method to obtain emotional embeddings based on rotational distance from neutral embeddings. Finally, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism that better integrates emotional information with linguistic content throughout the generation process.
### 2. CSEMOTIONS Dataset:
- We construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing approximately 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional native speakers (three male, three female), all with extensive voice acting experience. The dataset covers seven distinct emotional categories. All recordings were made in professional studios to ensure high audio quality and consistent emotional expression.
- We also develop 100 evaluation prompts for each emotion class across both existing datasets and CSEMOTIONS in English and Chinese, enabling thorough and standard assessment of emotional synthesis performance across all supported emotion categories.

### Evaluation

#### üéØ Objective Evaluation

We use the following metrics for objective evaluation:

  - **Emotion Classification Accuracy (ECA)**: Measures preservation of emotional content.
  - **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Measures transcription accuracy.
  - **Speaker Similarity (SIM)**: Quantifies speaker identity preservation.
  - **DNS-MOS**: Evaluates speech quality (0-5 scale).

#### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Implementation

#### 1. Emotion Classification Accuracy (ECA)
- **Tool**: [`emotion2vec`](https://huggingface.co/emotion2vec/emotion2vec_plus_large), as implemented in [`seed-tts-eval`](https://github.com/BytedanceSpeech/seed-tts-eval?tab=readme-ov-file#metrics)
- **Description**: Measures the accuracy of emotion recognition in synthesized or processed speech, comparing predicted emotions to ground-truth labels.
- **Method**:
    - Extract emotion embeddings using the fine-tuned `emotion2vec` model.
    - Classify emotions for both reference and test utterances.
    - Compute accuracy or F1-score based on alignment with reference emotions.
- **Language Support**: Primarily designed for English; performance for other languages may vary depending on model coverage.

#### 2. Word Error Rate (WER)
- **English ASR**: `Whisper-large-v3` (HuggingFace)
- **Mandarin ASR**: `Paraformer-zh` (ModelScope)
- **Supported Languages**:
    - Common: English (en), Mandarin (zh)
    - Minor languages (if compatible ASR models are available)
- **Error Types**: Insertion, deletion, substitution

#### 3. Speaker Similarity (SIM)
- **Primary Tool**: [`SpeechBrain`](https://speechbrain.github.io/) (higher reliability)
- **Alternative**: [`ESPNet`](https://espnet.github.io/) (more features)
- **Method**:
    - Extract speaker embeddings using verification models
    - Compute cosine similarity between test utterances and reference samples

#### 4. DNS-MOS
- **Tool**: [DNSMOS](https://github.com/microsoft/DNS-Challenge.git)
- **Output**: MOS score (0‚Äì5) for speech quality
- **Language Support**: Universal (no language-specific training required)


#### Input Examples

```json
{
  "uttr_001": {
    "text": "‰ªäÂ§©Â§©Ê∞îÁúüÂ•Ω",
    "audio_path": "data/audio/happy_001.wav",
    "style_label": "happy",
    "language_id":  'ch',
  },
  "uttr_002": {
    "text": "ËøôËÆ©ÊàëÂæàÂ§±Êúõ",
    "audio_path": "data/audio/sad_005.wav",
    "style_label": "sad",
    "language_id":  'ch'
  }
} 

bash Evaluation/cal_metrix.sh path_to_json_file path_to_output
```
üìå Notes
  Prefer SpeechBrain over ESPNet for SIM due to stability
  Ensure audio paths are absolute or relative to the working directory
  Use language_id to auto-select ASR models

*Implementation Notes:*  
- **CosyVoice1*** indicates continued training of the base model on the same dataset used by Marco-Voice, continual SFT on base model would naturally incur general performance degradation:  
  - Worse WER (58.4 vs 12.1 in LibriTTS, 23.3 vs 3.0 in AISHELL)  
  - Speaker similarity preservation challenges (SS-ERes2Net drops to 64.2/54.5 from 80.1/73.5)  
- Marco-Voice achieves better WER (11.4 vs 58.4) and speaker similarity (74.3 vs 64.2) than CosyVoice1* in LibriTTS despite added emotional control capabilities
